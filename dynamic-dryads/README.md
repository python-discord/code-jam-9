## Introducing `SpeeDebug`

Debugging can be motivating, but it isn't usually fun. _Simulated_ debugging
is another story. SpeeDebug is a browser-based multiplayer game that challenges
players to debug some seriously broken Python code. Each round consists of five
multiple-choice questions, each of which offers a snippet of bugged code and
several options for debugging it. Players receive one point for each correct
response. At the end of a game, whoever has the most points wins.

The first player to join a game can designate the maximum number of players.
Gameplay begins once that many players have joined.

It's a bug _and_ a feature.

## How To Play With Multiple People

We suggest utilizing `ngrok` to play online with multiple people. Start the server by running `poetry install` to install the project, and then `poetry run python -m server` to start the server. Then, sign up for a free ngrok account at https://ngrok.io and install the `ngrok` CLI using the site's instructions. Once ngrok is set up, you can use it to make the server available everywhere by running `ngrok tcp 8081` and sharing the forwarding link with friends.

To run the client locally, you must have `node` installed. Then, navigate to the client directory with  `cd ./client`, and install dependencies with `npm install`. The client can then be launched with `npm start`, which will make the client available on `localhost:8080`.

## Extending `SpeeDebug`

`SpeeDebug` ships with a bank of questions stored in `questions.json` in
the `server` directory. We encourage you to fork this repository and add
some of your own.
